Hello, my name is Timothy Pidashev! Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer currently expanding my technical horizons!

Waitâ€¦ that was a bit too formal. This is, after all, a blog post. Let me try that again.

Hey ðŸ‘‹, my name is Timothy! Iâ€™m a software nerd who loves building cool tech! Phew, that was rough. Jokes aside, 
Iâ€™m happy you're here, dear reader. I have a lot planned for my little blog, and I hope the next few posts will 
be useful to many nerds out there!

As a little spoiler of whatâ€™s to come, the next post will be a complete dive into modifying and corebooting a 
Thinkpad T440p for the ultimate secure dev laptop! Iâ€™ve been personally daily-driving mine for the last two 
years and canâ€™t wait to show it off, so stay tuned!
