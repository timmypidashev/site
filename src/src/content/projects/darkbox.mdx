## Overview
My gruvbox theme, with a pure black background

## Key Features
* **Pure Black Background**:, Preventing eyestrain during prolonged screen time.

* **Gruvbox Inspired**: Only the very best warm colorscheme, revamped for contrast.

* **Neovim First**: First class support for neovim, with treesitter support built in.

## Development Highlights
First, this project could not have been possible without the help of previous theme projects 
such as [gruvbox.nvim](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim). Major kudos to everyone
who helped write that plugin. Using existing code as reference from this project dramatically 
sped up development and made matters easy. 

On top of that, working with lua was delightful, and there were no roadblocks or glaring
issues which prevented me from completion. Neovim's tight integration with lua is a game
changer compared to something like [VimScript](https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_41.html). 
Overall, I found the whole experience simply perfect. 

## Challenges & Roadblocks
One thing I am not proud of, is how contrast has turned out. At the moment, the gruvbox dark 
colorscheme that inspired darkbox, isn't taking into account the contrast change from the 
background `#282828` to `#000000`. This, can show up as a bit washed out to the careful eye in certain
code blocks where multiple colors clash together. I intend to work on this in a future release. 
The fix will be to darken the color contrast to more closely match to the pure black background.

## Summary
This is it! This is the theme I am going to use for most likely the rest of my programming life.
I have always had a gruvbox themed desktop, but no background image. This resulted in an interesting
combo, and where the spark for this idea came from. I'm a bit biased, but I love it and hope 
someone else does too. The github link can be found [here](https://github.com/timmypidashev/darkbox.nvim) :D
